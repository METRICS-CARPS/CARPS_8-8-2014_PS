For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section of Experiment 2.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> We performed planned contrasts, guided by our aims to
replicate prior research and extend it by testing the
boundary conditions of Solomon’s paradox. To replicate
Study 1, we contrasted participants in the self-immersed
condition (self-immersion is a chronic tendency in North
American samples when thinking about the self;
Grossmann & Kross, 2010)—with participants in the
other-immersed and other-distanced conditions combined
(Contrast 1).3 As Figure 1 illustrates, we replicated
the results from Study 1: Participants in the other immersed
and other-distanced conditions showed higher
levels of wisdom than participants in the self-immersed
condition, t(113) = 3.93, p < .001, ηp 2 = .12. Extending prior research on reasoning about societal events (Kross & Grossmann, 2012), we next tested if people in the self distanced
condition reasoned more wisely about relationship
conflicts than participants in the self-immersed
condition (Contrast 2). This was indeed the case (see
Fig. 1), t(113) = 2.73, p = .007, ηp 2 = .06. We also tested whether reasoning about other people’s problems benefits from additional distance and found that participants in the other-distanced condition did not differ from participants in the other-immersed conditions (Contrast 3; see Fig. 1), t(113) = 0.56, n.s., ηp 2 = .003; we return to this finding in the General Discussion.
