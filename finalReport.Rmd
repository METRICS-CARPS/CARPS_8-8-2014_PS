#### Methods summary: 

The goal of this research was to understand the effects of psychological distancing on the ability to make "wise" decisions regarding personal situations. In the target study, Study 2, participants were randomly assigned within a 2x2, between-subjects manipulation (carried out in the lab): they heard about the infidelity of their own partner (self) or a friend's partner (other), then reflected on this and thought about the situation using either first person pronouns (immersed) or names/third-person pronouns (distanced). They then answered a group of "wisdom questions," which were the targets of the main analyses.

#### Target outcomes: 

> We performed planned contrasts, guided by our aims to replicate prior research and extend it by testing the boundary conditions of Solomon’s paradox. To replicate Study 1, we contrasted participants in the self-immersed condition (self-immersion is a chronic tendency in North American samples when thinking about the self; Grossmann & Kross, 2010)—with participants in the other-immersed and other-distanced conditions combined (Contrast 1).3 As Figure 1 illustrates, we replicated the results from Study 1: Participants in the other immersed and other-distanced conditions showed higher levels of wisdom than participants in the self-immersed condition, t(113) = 3.93, p < .001, ηp 2 = .12. Extending prior research on reasoning about societal events (Kross & Grossmann, 2012), we next tested if people in the self distanced condition reasoned more wisely about relationship conflicts than participants in the self-immersed condition (Contrast 2). This was indeed the case (see Fig. 1), t(113) = 2.73, p = .007, ηp 2 = .06. We also tested whether reasoning about other people’s problems benefits from additional distance and found that participants in the other-distanced condition did not differ from participants in the other-immersed conditions (Contrast 3; see Fig. 1), t(113) = 0.56, n.s., ηp 2 = .003; we return to this finding in the General Discussion.

```

# Step 2: Load data

```{r}
d_raw <- read_spss("data/study_2.update.sav")
```

# Step 3: Tidy data

First check number of participants.

> The recruitment strategy was identical to that used in Study 1. The final sample consisted of 120 native-English-speaking University of Michigan students (80 females). 

```{r}
descript <- d_raw %>%
  summarise(n = n(), 
            n_female = sum(gender == 1)) 

descript %>%
  kable
```

```{r}
reportObject <- reproCheck(reportedValue = "120", obtainedValue = descript$n, valueType = 'n')
reportObject <- reproCheck(reportedValue = "80", obtainedValue = descript$n_female, valueType = 'n')
```

Numbers match. 

Print also by condition so we can check below to ensure tidying did not remove participants. 

```{r}
d_raw %>%
  group_by(code) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), 
            n_female = sum(gender == 1)) %>%
  kable
```


Questions in this study are (Table 1):

> 1. Recognition of the limits of one’s own knowledge
a. In order to understand the situation better, how important do you feel it is to have more information about the circumstances of the experience you thought about? (Studies 1 and 2) [x]
c. Please, think about your answers from before. How certain are you in your statements? (reverse-coded; Studies 2 and 3; asked at the end of the questionnaire) [x]
2. Search for a compromise
a. How important is it for you to try to search for compromise? (Studies 1 and 2) [x]
b. When experiencing something like this, a person should generally be ready to put the well-being of the relationship over their personal interests. (Study 2) [x]
3. Consideration of other people’s perspectives
a. How much did you consider the perspectives of the other people involved in the conflict? (Studies 1 and 2) [x]
c. Thinking about this experience, to what extent do you feel like you were trying to understand the different viewpoints of the people involved in the experience? (Studies 2 and 3) [x]
4. Recognition of change/multiple ways the events may unfold 
a. Thinking about how the events with regard to this conflict will unfold in the future, how many different outcomes do you see? (Studies 1–3) 

From the included key, the following variables appear to map to these questions (mapping in parens):

* `persp`: How much did you consider the perspectives of the other people involved in this experience? [3c]
* `limits`: In order to understand the situation better, how important do you feel it is to have more information and knowledge about the circumstances of the experience you thought about? [1a]
* `compr1`:	How important would it be for you to try to search for a compromise in such a situation? [2a]
* `persp2`: Thinking about this experience, to what extent do feel like you were trying to understand the different viewpoints of the people involved in the experience? [3a]
* `compr3`: When experiencing something like this, a person should generally be ready to put the well-being of the relationship over their personal interests. [2b]
* `certainty`: Please, think about your answers from before. How certain are you in your answers/statements? [1c]

I investigated the hypothesis that Question 4a maps to:

* `p.future`: How do you think your relationship will develop in the futureafter this incident? Please use at least 5 minutes to type it down in the box below.

But that's a free-form description and I don't think that's what we're talking about. Given this I do not see a variable that maps to this one. Thus, this is an:

INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION ERROR

Ignoring this variable, we select down the variables we need for this analysis and then gather them into two dataframes. One has the wisdom composite, and one includes the variables. (Note this second stays in wide format for PCA). 

```{r}
# do some releveling using key
d_raw <- d_raw %>%
  mutate(distance = ifelse(distance == -.5, "immersed", "distancing"), 
         issue = ifelse(issue == -.5, "self", "other"))

d_allqs <- d_raw %>%
  select(ID, distance, issue, 
         persp, limits, compr1, persp2, compr3, certainty)

d <- d_raw %>%
  select(ID, distance, issue, FAC1_1)

```

# Step 4: Run analysis

## Pre-processing

Check about number of participants across conditions. 

```{r}
d %>% 
  group_by(distance, issue) %>%
  summarise(n = length(unique(ID))) %>%
  kable()
```

Confirming that all participants are retained for this next step. 

We can now try to redo the PCA to create the wisdom score.

```{r}
d_allqs_mat <- as.matrix(select(d_allqs, persp, limits, compr1, persp2, compr3, certainty))
pcs <- princomp(d_allqs_mat)

d$new_pca <- pcs$scores[,1]

ggplot(d, aes(x = FAC1_1, y = new_pca)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Overall it is clear that there is a strong correlation ($r = `r signif(cor(d$FAC1_1, d$new_pca, use="pairwise.complete.obs"), digits = 3)`$) between these two PCAs, but they are not identical (likely because of the missing variable) and there are no NAs in the recomputed one. 

## Descriptive statistics

Note that there are 5 NAs in FAC1_1. Not sure how these are dealt with in the paper, but they are there in the original `d_raw`.

INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION ERROR

It's not clear what is happening with the NAs but I am assuming that they are simply excluded. Part of the issue is that I don't know why they are NAs. It doesn't look like any data are missing.

```{r}
filter(d_allqs, is.na(d$FAC1_1)) %>%
  kable()
```


They are not concentrated in one condition. 

```{r}
d %>%
  group_by(distance, issue) %>%
  summarise(n_nas = sum(is.na(FAC1_1))) %>%
  kable()
```


We want to reproduce Figure 1:

![Figure 1](images/fig1.png)

```{r}
ms <- d %>%
  group_by(distance, issue) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(FAC1_1, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sem = std.error(FAC1_1, na.rm=TRUE))

ggplot(ms, 
       aes(x = issue, y = mean, fill = distance)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", 
           position = "dodge") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - sem, 
                    ymax = mean + sem), 
                width = .2, 
                position = position_dodge(width = .9)) + 
  ylim(-.8, .6) + 
  theme_few() + 
  scale_fill_solarized() + 
  ylab("Wise Reasoning Composite")
```

This generally looks similar - there might be some small numerical differences in the error bars but it's hard to tell just by eyeballing.  

## Inferential statistics

Repeating analyses from above:

> Participants in the other immersed and other-distanced conditions showed higher levels of wisdom than participants in the self-immersed condition, t(113) = 3.93, p < .001, ηp 2 = .12. 

This statistical test is a bit confusing because we have both a $t$-value (typically from a $t$-test) and a partial $\eta^2$, which typically results from an ANOVA ($F$-test). 

We could do a $t$-test between the contrasted groups that are specified, but the degrees of freedom are not correct. Likely this is an ANOVA variant so we can just compute $t = \sqrt{F}$. 

```{r}
d_nona <- filter(d, !is.na(FAC1_1)) 

d_contrast <- d_nona %>%
  mutate(contrast1 = case_when(issue == "other" ~ 1, 
                               issue == "self" & distance == "immersed" ~ -1, 
                               TRUE ~ 0),
         contrast2 = case_when(issue == "self" & distance == "immersed" ~ 1, 
                               issue == "self" & distance == "distancing" ~ -1, 
                               TRUE ~ 0),
         contrast3 = case_when(issue == "other" & distance == "immersed" ~ 1, 
                               issue == "other" & distance == "distancing" ~ -1, 
                               TRUE ~ 0))
```

Contrast 1 ANOVA. The degrees of freedom are consistent with all data being included, but the contrast being set to zero for comparisons that are not of interest. 

```{r}
c1_aov <- ezANOVA(data = d_contrast, 
                  dv = FAC1_1, 
                  wid = ID, 
                  between = .(contrast1), 
                  type = 3)

c1_f <- c1_aov$ANOVA$F
c1_t <- sqrt(c1_aov$ANOVA$F)
c1_p <- c1_aov$ANOVA$p
c1_ges <- c1_aov$ANOVA$ges

reportObject <- reproCheck(reportedValue = '< .001', 
                           obtainedValue = c1_p,
                           valueType = 'p', eyeballCheck = TRUE)
reportObject <- reproCheck(reportedValue = '3.93', 
                           obtainedValue = c1_t,
                           valueType = 't')
reportObject <- reproCheck(reportedValue = '.12', 
                           obtainedValue = c1_ges,
                           valueType = 'pes')
```

> Extending prior research on reasoning about societal events (Kross & Grossmann, 2012), we next tested if people in the self distanced condition reasoned more wisely about relationship conflicts than participants in the self-immersed condition (Contrast 2). This was indeed the case (see Fig. 1), t(113) = 2.73, p = .007, ηp 2 = .06.

                  between = .(contrast2), 
                  type = 3)

                           obtainedValue = c2_p,

# Step 5: Conclusion

We generally reproduced all findings of the paper, despite some major numerical errors in small values. My suspicion is that these are largely caused by SPSS/R differences; this hypothesis could be tested directly. 

```{r}
Author_Assistance = FALSE # was author assistance provided? (if so, enter TRUE)

Insufficient_Information_Errors <- 2 # how many discrete insufficient information issues did you encounter?

# Assess the causal locus (discrete reproducibility issues) of any reproducibility errors. Note that there doesn't necessarily have to be a one-to-one correspondance between discrete reproducibility issues and reproducibility errors. For example, it could be that the original article neglects to mention that a Greenhouse-Geisser correct was applied to ANOVA outcomes. This might result in multiple reproducibility errors, but there is a single causal locus (discrete reproducibility issue).

locus_typo <- 0 # how many discrete issues did you encounter that related to typographical errors?
locus_specification <- 1 # how many discrete issues did you encounter that related to incomplete, incorrect, or unclear specification of the original analyses?
locus_analysis <- 0 # how many discrete issues did you encounter that related to errors in the authors' original analyses?
locus_data <- 0 # how many discrete issues did you encounter that related to errors in the data files shared by the authors?
locus_unidentified <- 1 # how many discrete issues were there for which you could not identify the cause

Affects_Conclusion <- FALSE # Do any reproducibility issues encounter appear to affect the conclusions made in the original article? TRUE, FALSE, or NA. This is a subjective judgement, but you should taking into account multiple factors, such as the presence/absence of decision errors, the number of target outcomes that could not be reproduced, the type of outcomes that could or could not be reproduced, the difference in magnitude of effect sizes, and the predictions of the specific hypothesis under scrutiny.
